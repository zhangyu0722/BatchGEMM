# Introduction
This repository provides a collection of kernel functions that enable high-speed computation of Batch GEMM (general matrix-matrix multiplication).   This repository contains the implementation and benchmark code on two GPU platforms (AMD and NVIDIA).  This repository is the source code of "A load-balanced parallel framework for batch general matrix multiplication on GPU".
